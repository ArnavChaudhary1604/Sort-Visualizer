# Sort-Visualizer
A focused web application to visualize how sorting algorithms work in real-time using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application built to visualize classic sorting algorithms in real-time. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how different algorithms function by animating the sorting process. It is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external libraries.

## Key Features

* **Algorithm Support:** Includes implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
* **Interactive Controls:** Users can adjust the sorting speed and the size of the array (number of bars).
* **Random Array Generation:** A button to instantly generate a new set of random data to sort.
* **Color-Coded Visualization:**
    * **Blue:** Default state of elements.
    * **Red:** Elements currently being compared or swapped.
    * **Green:** Elements that are in their final sorted position.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the application structure.
* **CSS3:** For styling the user interface and visual bars.
* **JavaScript:** For the sorting logic and DOM manipulation.

## Future Improvements
* Adding time complexity details for each algorithm on the screen.
* Implementing more complex algorithms like Heap Sort.
* Mobile responsiveness improvements.
